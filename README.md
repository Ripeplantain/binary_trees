This is for my binary tree assigment

0-binary_tree_node.c: C function that creates a binary tree node with a given parent and value.
Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.

Insert left
1-binary_tree_insert: C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another.
Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
If the given parent already contains a left node, the new node takes its place and the old left-child becomes the left-child of the new node.

Insert right
2-binary_tree_insert_right.c: C function that inserts a node as the right-child of another.
Returns a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure.
If the given parent already contains a right node, the new node takes its place and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.

Delete
3-binary_tree_delete.c: C function that deletes an entire binary tree.

Is leaf
4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c: C function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
Returns 1 if the node is a leaf, 0 otherwise.

Is root
5-binary_tree_is_root.c: C function that checks if a given node is a root.
Returns 1 if the node is a root, 0 otherwise.

Pre-order traversal
6-binary_tree_preorder.c: C function that traverses a tree using pre-order traversal.

In-order traversal
7-binary_tree_inorder.c: C function that traverses a tree using in-order traversal.

Post-order traversal
8-binary_tree_postorder.c: C function that traverses a tree using post-order traversal.

Height
9-binary_tree_height.c: C function that returns the height of a binary tree.

Depth
10-binary_tree_depth.c: C function that returns the depth of a given node in a binary tree.

Size
11-binary_tree_size.c: C function that returns the size of a binary tree.

Leaves
12-binary_tree_leaves.c: C function that returns the number of leaves in a binary tree.

Nodes
13-binary_tree_nodes.c: C function that returns the number of nodes in a binary tree with at least one child.

Balance factor
14-binary_tree_balance.c: C function that returns the balance factor of a binary tree.

Is full
15-binary_tree_is_full.c: C function that checks if a binary tree is full.
Returns 1 if a tree is full, 0 otherwise.

Is perfect
16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c: C function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
Returns 1 if a tree is perfect, 0 otherwise.

Sibling
17-binary_tree_sibling.c: C function that returns a pointer to the sibling of a given node in a binary tree.
Returns NULL if no sibling is found.

Uncle
18-binary_tree_uncle.c: C function that returns a pointer to the uncle of a given node in a binary tree.
Returns NULL if no uncle is found.
